## Permissions System

Each user on a board can have a set of permissions that determine what actions are available.  

| Permission Key             | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **manage-board**            | Allows editing the board (title, description). |
| **delete-board**            | Allows deleting the board. |
| **manage-board-statuses**   | Allows adding and editing statuses (columns). |
| **delete-board-statuses**   | Allows deleting statuses (columns). |
| **manage-board-users**      | Allows managing board members (invite, remove, change permissions). |

**Important:**  
If a user does **not** have a permission, related buttons or actions will not even be displayed in the UI.
